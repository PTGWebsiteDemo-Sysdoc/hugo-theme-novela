# FASHIONABLE BANANAS:

\**The food shortage** has made many people hungry, but when you can’t find anything to eat, sometimes all you can find is a banana. They’re the most versatile food on earth, but in a world with such a diverse selection of fruit, why do we choose to eat just one type of banana? The answer is simple: fashion. Bananas have been popular as an accessory for decades; they have been worn as hats, used as leis, and even as weapons.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that the bananas I usually buy at the grocery store were suddenly a lot harder to find. I figured maybe they were on sale, so I didn't think much of it. But when I went to buy more today, I only found a few left on the shelves, and none that were even close to being ripe. It didn't seem like a big deal at first, but as I drove home, I realized that I would have to wait a while before I could have my favorite snack again.

The banana is a food that I hold near and dear to my heart. I love the way they taste and the way they go perfectly with anything I eat. But lately, I've noticed that the banana supply has been running low. It seems like everywhere I go, there are fewer bananas and when I ask for some, I'm given a funny look.
